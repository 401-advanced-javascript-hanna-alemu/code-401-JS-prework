### 301 Code Review / Challenges

It is recommended that you read the README, watch the Videos, and Do/Re-Do the challenges

Challenges are **required** if you have tested into 401 or have a layoff > 1 week between 301 & 401

These readings/challenges are individually linked in Canvas as assignments as well

**To turn this assignment in**

- Create a new repository on github called `code-challenges` if you haven't already done so
- Clone this to your computer, under your `codefellows` working folder
- Upload the  jest.config.js file into your `code-challenges` folder (found in the "configs" folder of this repository)
- Create a new folder for each of these challenges
- Write your code for each challenge in a file called "challenge.test.js" in each folder
- Ensure that running `jest challenge.test.js` passes for all tests
- Provide a link to the master branch of this repo in canvas

Jest is a test runner that will execute against every file named "challenge.test.js" in your repository.
