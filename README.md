# Code 401: Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack JavaScript

### Pre-work

This is the mandatory pre-work for Code 401: JavaScript that counts as 5% of your total course grade. When this course nears its start date, you will be invited to an online portal named Canvas where you can confirm that you've completed this prework and claim credit.

Start on the pre-work as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it. Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks and not get overwhelmed.

##### 1. Setup your computer with Terminal, Git, GitHub, and Slack
- [Download Slack](https://slack.com/downloads/osx)

##### 2. Install Node the right way, following the instructions found [here](https://github.com/codefellows/code-401-JS-prework/blob/master/install-node.md)

##### 3. If you do not already have a current draft/copy of your resume, please create or update by the time we begin class. You will be working to improve your resume as part of Career Development during and after the course.

### Optional Pre-work
If you have time and want to review some Javscript fundamentals there are two main resources you should look at.  A few chapters from the You Don't Know JS series are sectioned off as reading assignments but it's fine if you want to get a head start:
- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
- [You Don't Know JS series](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) (specifically, the "Scopes and Closures" and "this & Object Prototypes" books)

If you are testing into 401 or need additional practice on GIT, check out the following Udemy course.  This should help get you up to speed:
